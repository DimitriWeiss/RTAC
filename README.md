Realtime Algorithm Configuration Methods

This Software is a refactored version of the software used in "Pool-Based Realtime Algorithm Configuration" and "Realtime gray-box algorithm configuration using cost-sensitive classification". It has also extended options regarding logging, input, e.g. parameter space via PCS files, and target algorithm calls.
