RTAC: A Realtime Algorithm Configuration Methods Suite

This Software is a reimplementation of the realtime algorithm configurators (RAC) described in "ReACTR: Realtime Algorithm Configuration through Tournament Rankings" :cite:`ReACTR` (ReACTR), a light extension of ReACTR incorporating additional output at tournament end (ReACTR++), "Pool-Based Realtime Algorithm Configuration" :cite:`CPPL` (CPPL) and "Realtime gray-box algorithm configuration using cost-sensitive classification" :cite:`GB, GB_extended` (gray-box RAC) into a collective RAC suite. It also includes extended options regarding logging, input, e.g. parameter space via PCS files, and target algorithm calls. It is possible to use the gray-box functioality with ReACTR, ReACTR++ and CPPL.

Additionally, the library is intended to encourage further research by being written in a way that facilitates the introduction of further RAC approaches. Pull requests at `Github <https://github.com/DimitriWeiss/RTAC>`_ and reporting of bugs are welcome.
